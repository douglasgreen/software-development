## 10x developers

There is a myth about 10x developers. There was a study one time that showed that some people take 10 times longer than other people to do a programming task. Some people like to infer because of that study that there are certain rock star developers that are 10 times more productive than other developers. That is the myth of 10x developer. That myth is complete nonsense.

Here are several major defects of that interpretation.

1. The study involved a mix of programmers and non-programmers, so you can't say that the conclusion proved that some developers are 10 times better than other developers.
2. The study didn't specify that the people were supposed to finish as quickly as possible, so some people arbitrarily took more time than others.
3. Programming assignments are open-ended, allowing the person to reinterpret them to have less features or more features.
4. 10 times faster is not the same as 10 times better. The people who took extra time might have simply been more thorough.
5. The study is a single data point not a comparison of average performances.

Imagine a different study about runners. We take a mix of athletes and non-athletes down to the track. We tell each one of them to run for a while. Some of them run for 5 minutes and stop and some of them run for a whole hour before stopping. Some of them took 12x as long to finish running as others, we conclude that the runners who finished in 5 minutes are 12x as better as a runner than those who ran without stopping for one hour.

This conclusion is not just wrong, it is stupid wrong.
1. It is a mix of athletes and non-athletes, so it doesn't really tell us about the performance of athletes.
2. We didn't tell people that they were being timed, so they didn't necessarily run as fast as they could run.
3. They ran different amounts based on how much they felt like running, so their times aren't directly comparable.
4. It's absurd to conclude that somebody who quit running 12x faster is therefore 12x a better athlete. In fact the opposite is likely true.
5. The study is a single data point not a comparison of average performances.

As such, I strongly conclude that the idea that some developers are on average 10x as productive as other developers is an unfounded myth. Mistaking unfounded myths for reality is likely to result in poor decision making. Such a program are we looking for silver bullets that don't exist.

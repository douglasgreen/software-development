# Commit Message Guidelines

Commit messages serve as a critical documentation for your code changes. Following best practices helps make the messages consistent and useful to other developers. Here's how you can write effective commit messages:

## 1. **Subject Line**:
   - **Concise and Meaningful**: Limit to 50 characters or less.
   - **Start with a Verb**: Use the imperative mood.
   - **Avoid Technical Jargon**: Be clear and descriptive.

## 2. **Message Body**:
   - **Explain Details**: Describe why the change was made and any relevant context.
   - **Reference Issues or Bugs**: If applicable, mention related issues.
   - **Proper Grammar**: Write complete sentences with correct punctuation.
   - **Length**: Keep the subject line under 72 characters and body under 72 columns.

## 3. **Semantic Commit Messages**:
   - **Standardized Format**: Each message consists of a type, scope, and subject.
   - **Example**: `feat(auth): add password reset feature`.
   - **Common Types**:
      - `feat`: New feature.
      - `fix`: Bug fix.
      - `docs`: Documentation changes.
      - `style`: Code formatting.
      - `refactor`: Non-behavior-altering code change.
      - `perf`: Performance improvement.
      - `test`: Testing infrastructure.
      - `chore`: Non-functional changes.
      - `revert`: Reverts a previous commit.

# Purpose of Commit Message Body

The body of a commit message provides valuable context and details about the changes. It explains why the changes were made, includes any relevant background information, and may highlight related issues or bugs. It's designed to help others understand the changes, fostering effective collaboration and streamlined code review.

# Semantic Commit Messages

Semantic commit messages are a method of structuring commit messages to make them more readable and understandable. This convention benefits the management of a codebase by enabling automation in versioning and making code review more efficient.

# How to Use Commit Messages for Easier Review

Good commit messages can make the review process more transparent and straightforward:

   - **Be Descriptive**: Clearly outline the purpose and impact of the changes.
   - **Mention Related Issues**: Link related changes through issue numbers.
   - **Keep Commits Small**: Address specific changes in focused commits.
   - **Use Semantic Commit Messages**: Utilize the convention for categorization.
   - **Provide Context**: Include relevant background information.
   - **Avoid Technical Complexity**: Use language that's accessible to all team members.

By adhering to these guidelines, developers can communicate changes effectively, maintain a clear history of the codebase, and facilitate easier code review.

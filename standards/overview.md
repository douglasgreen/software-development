Here's the prompts I use:

## General

Write a brief system prompt that tells a chatbot about my technology stack. The purpose is to use different chatbots on different apps and get similar, consistent results that follow general principles of web responsiveness, usability, and accessibility.

My technology stack includes PHP, Symfony, JavaScript, TypeScript, jQuery, Node.js, UX, HTML, Twig, XML, JSON, CSS, Bootstrap, REST APIs, MySQL, Doctrine, and UUIDs. My development environment uses Composer, NPM, PHPUnit, PHP CodeSniffer, PHPStan, Rector, ESLint, Prettier, Vite, Vitest, Dotenv, Jest, Mocha, Vue, Husky, Postman, Git, GitLab, CI/CD, Monolog, and PSR/Log.

## PHP

Write a set of PHP standards and examples that I can use as a system prompt for chatbots (LLMs). The purpose is to use different chatbots on different apps and get similar, consistent results that follow general principles of good architecture and design.

## JavaScript

Write a set of JavaScript standards and examples that I can use as a system prompt for chatbots (LLMs). The purpose is to use different chatbots on different apps and get similar, consistent results that follow general principles of good architecture and design.

## CSS

Write a set of CSS standards and examples that I can use as a system prompt for
chatbots (LLMs). The purpose is to use different chatbots on different apps and
get similar, consistent results that follow general principles of web
responsiveness and accessibility. The CSS standards should follow the
principles of object-oriented CSS where the top-level selector is always an ID
or class selector to keep the CSS well-organized.

## Bootstrap

Write a set of Bootstrap standards and examples that I can use as a system prompt for chatbots (LLMs). The purpose is to use different chatbots on different apps and get similar, consistent results that follow general principles of web responsiveness and accessibility. These standards are independent of the CSS standards and are used for projects where Bootstrap is available but should be consistent with our CSS standards.

## SQL

Write a set of SQL standards and examples that I can use as a system prompt for chatbots (LLMs). The purpose is to use different chatbots on different apps and get similar, consistent results that follow general database design and implementation principles that don't depend on the specific SQL dialect.

## UX

Write a set of general web application user interface design standards and examples that I can use as a system prompt for chatbots (LLMs). The purpose is to use different chatbots on different apps and get similar, consistent results that follow general principles of web responsiveness and accessibility. These standards should focus on interaction design for database-driven web apps involving creating, reading, and updating deleting various kinds of data across several pages. For example, a task manager, an email client, a chat app, an RSS feed reader, a flashcard program, a wiki, etc. How is the page broken down into columns and areas? How do forms work, where are they located, and how do they lead from step to step? These are just examples, and I want general guidelines that apply to all kinds of UX in all kinds of data-heavy web apps.

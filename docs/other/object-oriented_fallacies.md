# Object-oriented fallacies

## Objects are like the real world

That's false because all programming languages have objects. Objects are just the nouns of the
language. What's different about OOP is that it is object-oriented, meaning that it puts the objects
first and encapsulate methods within them.

## Objects are the only way to achieve modularity

That's false because modularity is a more general design technique than objects.

## OOP increases your productivity

OOP doesn't increase your productivity substantially. Studies show only a minor increase in code
reuse. Code reuse occasionally valuable but it's value can be overestimated.

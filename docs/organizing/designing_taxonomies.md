# Designing Taxonomies

Taxonomies are either tags or hierarchies. Tags are a collection of labels where one or more tags
can be applied to an item. The benefit is that they are flexible and ambiguous. The cost is that
they don't provide much structure.

Hierarchies are more difficult to define but they provide structure and are unambiguous. The
difficulty is that most items are ambiguous in that they fall in more than one category. So you have
to decide how to order the categories from top to bottom in the hierarchy.

## Guidelines

When designing a taxonomy, it's crucial to balance the number of items in each category to ensure
the hierarchy is both manageable and user-friendly. Here are some guidelines based on best
practices:

1. **Hierarchy Depth**:

    - Aim for a hierarchy depth of 3 to 5 levels. This depth allows for sufficient granularity
      without overwhelming the user.

2. **Number of Categories**:

    - For the top-level categories, aim for 5 to 15 categories. This range provides a broad overview
      without being too sparse or too cluttered.

3. **Items per Category**:

    - Each category should ideally contain between 5 and 50 items. Fewer than 5 items might make the
      category seem unnecessary, while more than 50 items can overwhelm users and make it difficult
      to find specific items.

4. **Avoiding Over-Specificity**:

    - Avoid creating too many specific categories that result in an excessive number of categories.
      This can make navigation cumbersome and confusing.

5. **Attributes and Values**:

    - There is no strict limit on the number of attributes and values. More attributes can enhance
      descriptions and improve searchability. However, ensure that attributes are relevant and
      useful for the user.

6. **User Behavior and Iteration**:

    - Regularly review and adjust your categories based on user behavior and metrics. This helps in
      keeping the taxonomy relevant and user-friendly over time.

7. **Avoid "Other" Categories**:
    - Instead of using an "Other" category, create specific categories that accurately describe the
      items. This improves clarity and helps users find what they are looking for more easily.

By following these guidelines, you can create a taxonomy that is both intuitive and efficient,
enhancing the overall user experience.

## Naming

When naming categories within a product taxonomy, it's important to follow certain principles to
ensure clarity, consistency, and ease of navigation for users. Here are some key principles:

1. **Top-Level Categories**:

    - Use one-word names for top-level categories. These should be broad and easily understandable,
      providing a clear overview of the main sections of your product catalog. Examples include
      "Electronics," "Clothing," "Books," etc.

2. **Subcategories**:

    - Use two or three-word names for subcategories. This allows for more specificity and helps
      users understand the exact nature of the items within the category. Examples include "Men's
      Shoes," "Women's Jackets," "Smart Home Devices," etc.

3. **Consistency**:

    - Maintain a consistent naming convention throughout the taxonomy. This includes using similar
      structures and styles for names at the same level. For instance, if you use "Men's" and
      "Women's" for clothing, ensure all related subcategories follow this pattern.

4. **Clarity and Simplicity**:

    - Names should be clear and straightforward, avoiding jargon or overly complex terms. The goal
      is to make it easy for users to understand what they will find in each category without
      confusion.

5. **Descriptive and Specific**:

    - Subcategory names should be descriptive enough to convey the specific type of items they
      contain. This helps in reducing ambiguity and improving the user experience.

6. **Avoid Redundancy**:

    - Ensure that category names are unique and do not overlap in meaning. Redundant or overlapping
      categories can confuse users and make navigation difficult.

7. **User-Centric Language**:

    - Use language that your target audience is familiar with. This involves understanding how your
      customers describe and search for items, and aligning your category names with these terms.

8. **Scalability**:
    - Design category names with future growth in mind. Ensure that the naming convention can
      accommodate new items and categories without requiring significant restructuring.

By adhering to these principles, you can create a product taxonomy that is intuitive, user-friendly,
and scalable, enhancing the overall shopping experience for your customers.

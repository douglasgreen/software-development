# Review of "Programming as Theory Building" by Peter Naur

Peter Naur wrote an article called
["Programming as Theory Building](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Naur.pdf)". In it, he says
programming isn't just about writing code. It's about really understanding the problem you're trying
to solve.

Naur uses the idea of "theory" from a philosopher named Gilbert Ryle. Basically, it's the deep
knowledge someone has when they can do something, explain it, answer questions about it, and more.
When a programmer deeply understands a problem, they build this kind of knowledge.

This deep knowledge isn't just about facts. It also includes understanding that's hard to put into
words or write down. You can't easily share it in notes or documents. It's best passed on through
teaching and working closely with others.

According to Naur, when a programmer has this deep knowledge about a program, they can:

1. Explain how the software connects to the real problem it solves.
2. Talk about why they wrote each part of the code.
3. Make changes to the software if the real-world problem changes.

He believes that programming is mostly about thinking, talking, and agreeing with others. It's more
than just what's written down. This idea changes how we think about teaching programming and how we
work with software that already exists.

In short, Naur's article tells us that truly understanding a problem and its solution is the heart
of good programming. This deep understanding is hard to write down, but it can be passed on by
teaching and working together.

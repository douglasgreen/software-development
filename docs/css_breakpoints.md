# CSS Breakpoint Guidelines

In web design, CSS breakpoints help websites look good on different devices. Here's how a three-size
system compares to other methods:

## Three-size system

-   **Small (mobile)**: Under 600px

    -   For smartphones.
    -   Shows only key content for small screens.

-   **Medium (tablets)**: 600px to 1200px

    -   For tablets.
    -   Mixes mobile and desktop looks, sometimes using drop-down menus.

-   **Large (desktops)**: Over 1200px
    -   For desktop screens.
    -   Shows the full website.

**Pros**:

-   **Simple**: Three sizes make designing and testing easier. It reduces mistakes.
-   **Flexible**: Developers can add more sizes for specific pages if needed.

## Other systems

Some designs use more sizes, like:

-   **Very Small (tiny phones)**: Usually under 480px
-   **Small (bigger phones)**: 480px to 768px
-   **Medium (tablets)**: 768px to 992px
-   **Large (small desktops)**: 992px to 1200px
-   **Very Large (big desktops and TVs)**: Over 1200px

**Pros**:

-   **Exact**: More sizes can fit more devices just right.
-   **Adaptable**: Can handle unique design problems from different devices, like very big phones or
    very wide screens.

**Cons**:

-   **Complicated**: More sizes make design and testing harder and can lead to mistakes.
-   **Upkeep**: More sizes mean more things might break when updating or changing the design.

To sum it up, the three-size system is easy and quick, but you should think about what devices your
audience uses. If they use many different devices, a system with more sizes might work better. But
for a lot of websites, three sizes are good enough.

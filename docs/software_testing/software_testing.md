# Software Testing

## Types of testing

There are different kinds of testing. The reason that they work together is:

-   Each type of testing works differently and catches different kinds of bugs.
-   The law of diminishing returns sets in and it's harder for each type to catch more bugs.

Therefore the law of the golden mean or the Pareto Principle should be applied to software testing
methods. The law of the golden mean states that you should use things not too little and not too
much. The Pareto Principle says that 20% of your efforts can produce 80% of the results.

So the point is not to engage in one dimensional thinking and overused one method and the assumption
that it solves all problems. This is a general conclusion that describes more than just software
testing. It describes the balance of methods that look at the big picture and use a multi-pronged
approach that tries to get sufficient coverage to all areas.

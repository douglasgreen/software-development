# SOLID Principles Explained

## Introduction

The SOLID principles serve as fundamental design concepts for object-oriented
software. This acronym stands for

-   **S** - Single-Responsibility Principle (SRP)
-   **O** - Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
-   **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
-   **I** - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
-   **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Let's delve deeper into each principle and articulate them with clarity.

## Single-Responsibility Principle (SRP)

### Original statement

> A class should have one and only one reason to change.

### Revised statement

> A class should be responsible for a single functionality or concept. Its name
> should reflect its purpose. To further ensure clarity and maintainability, its
> methods should be aligned with unit testing practices, separating easily
> testable logic from aspects like IO operations or storage which may be more
> challenging to test.

### Discussion

In the era of modern version control, the original statement of the
Single-Responsibility Principle (SRP) suggesting that a class should have only
one reason to change may seem outdated. Nevertheless, the core essence of SRP
remains pertinent. It advocates for a class to serve a singular purpose, which
should be evident from its name, emphasizing high cohesion within its
components. Moreover, aligning a class's purpose with unit testing practices
bolsters this principle. This alignment necessitates separating easily testable
functionalities, such as application logic and domain calculations, from more
intricate testing areas like input, output, and storage.

SRP is often stated as "A class should only have one reason to change." However,
this phrasing might be viewed as limited for the following reasons:

-   **Predicting Change**: Defining a single "reason to change" can be
    challenging as it attempts to anticipate future needs, which are inherently
    unpredictable.
-   **Modern Development Practices**: In contemporary development environments,
    having multiple reasons for a class to change is less of an issue. Robust
    version control systems can efficiently handle and reconcile these changes.

## Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

### Original statement

> Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

### Revised statement

> Design your classes so they can be extended or adapted without having to
> modify their existing structure. While direct modifications can sometimes be
> warranted, aim for a design that encourages extensions through mechanisms like
> interfaces, inheritance, or composition.

### Discussion

In light of contemporary software practices, the Open-Closed Principle (OCP) can
seem archaic, stemming from an era before advanced version control when altering
classes was more challenging. The language of a class being "open" or "closed"
might appear ambiguous. While direct modification of classes can be both
practical and efficient in certain scenarios, OCP emphasizes the value of
designing classes that can be extended without altering their foundational
structure. The principle shouldn't be viewed as an absolute prohibition against
modifying code, but rather as guidance to promote flexible designs through
mechanisms such as interfaces, inheritance, or composition.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

### Original statement

> Let q(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T. Then q(y) should be
> provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.

### Revised statement

> Subclasses should seamlessly integrate into the application without breaking
> the behavior expected from the parent class. In simpler terms, you should be
> able to replace any instance of a parent class with an instance of a subclass
> without affecting the program's correctness.

### Discussion

In essence, this principle emphasizes the importance of maintaining consistent
behavior across subclasses and their parent classes. If subclasses diverge in
behavior from their superclasses, it jeopardizes the seamless substitution of
one for the other, potentially undermining polymorphism and leading to
unforeseen errors in the application.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

### Original statement

> A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesnâ€™t use.

### Revised statement

> Interfaces should be crafted to be both minimal and specific. They should
> provide just the necessary methods that the implementer will require, ensuring
> that implementers aren't burdened with irrelevant methods. This ensures that
> all implementers of an interface can be interchanged seamlessly.

### Discussion

The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP), often considered a weaker principle,
may actually hold more relevance to user interface design than conventional
programming. In programming, interfaces, typically defined around a singular
purpose, aren't mandatorily imposed on any client for implementation. The
principle resonates more when viewed through the lens of user interface design,
emphasizing the need to account for diverse user perspectives during interface
development. Much like the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP), which allows
subclasses to replace superclasses seamlessly, the ISP advocates for the
flawless interchangeability of interface implementers. Failing to uphold the
principle might, at best, saddle implementers with undesired functions, but at
its worst, can precipitate significant errors and code disruptions.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

### Original statement

> Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions.

### Revised statement

> Aim to depend on abstract concepts (like interfaces or abstract classes)
> rather than concrete implementations. However, it's essential to recognize
> when to introduce abstraction layers. Introduce them when they facilitate
> flexibility or substitutability, but avoid over-engineering. Remember the
> YAGNI principle: "You Aren't Gonna Need It". Avoid introducing complexity when
> there's no clear need.

### Discussion

The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) advises leaning towards abstractions
such as interfaces or abstract classes, rather than concrete implementations.
However, it's vital to note that this isn't an absolute mandate. The call for
abstraction should be judicious, applied when it offers clear benefits in
flexibility or substitutability. Introducing unnecessary abstractions can lead
to unwarranted complexity, violating the YAGNI ("You Aren't Gonna Need It")
principle. Thus, while DIP provides a guideline, it underscores the broader
ethos: avoid needless complexity and ensure that each layer of abstraction
genuinely serves a purpose.

## Conclusion

By adhering to these principles, developers can create software that's modular,
maintainable, and scalable. It's essential, however, to apply them judiciously
and in the context of the specific challenges at hand.

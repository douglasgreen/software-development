# Iterative and Incremental Development

## What does it mean?

Iterative and Incremental development are two approaches used in designing products, such as
software. Here's a basic breakdown:

### Iterative design

-   **Iterative** means repeating something.
-   In the context of design, iterative design involves repeatedly revising a project based on
    feedback from previous versions.
-   Think of it as a cycle of continuous improvement.

### Incremental design

-   **Incremental** means adding to something in small amounts.
-   Incremental design starts with a base system that works, and then new parts are added gradually.
-   It's like building a structure piece by piece, making sure everything works at each step.

## How do they work in real life?

Let's consider an example from publishing to understand these concepts:

1. **Fixed Model**: A book is published once, and never changed (common for novels).
2. **Iterative Model**: A book is published and then improved in later editions based on feedback
   (common for textbooks).
3. **Incremental Model**: A book starts with the basics and then is republished with new material
   multiple times. It's like the second model but faster, allowing for earlier feedback.

## Applying these models to software

Most software development uses the second or third model described above:

### The iterative model

-   Software is released fully and then improved with user feedback.
-   Real users' feedback helps find errors and areas for improvement.
-   It's generally easier to get feedback on a finished product rather than an idea.

### The incremental model

-   Often considered the best for software, this approach starts with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
    that contains the core features.
-   Then, improvements and features are added one by one.
-   Benefits of this approach include:
    -   **Faster Availability**: Essential features reach users quickly.
    -   **Modular Design**: Building in stages promotes well-organized components, avoiding a
        chaotic "big ball of mud" structure.
    -   **Continuous Operation**: Keeping the system working at each stage
        [lowers the risk of total project failure](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business-insights-ideas/resources/the-6-not-so-obvious-reasons-a-project-plan-fails).

## Conclusion

Both iterative and incremental models offer valuable strategies for product development. While the
iterative approach emphasizes continuous improvement through feedback, the incremental approach
focuses on building up a product in stages. In the world of software development, these methods
provide practical frameworks to build more effective and user-centered products.

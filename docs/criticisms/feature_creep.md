# Feature Creep

Many products in the market are constructed as a collection of features, subscribing to the belief
that more features equate to a more powerful product. This mindset is also prevalent in the design
of programming languages. The addition of features, however, leads to increased complexity and does
not always adequately justify the achieved goals or added value of the new feature. In essence, each
feature is considered to be cost-free, often addressing a marginal use case that fails to
significantly boost the product's value. Unfortunately, the cumulative effect of these features
escalates the cost, complexity, and maintainability of the system, creating a sprawling and
burdensome infrastructure that contributes only minimal additional value.

To mitigate this phenomenon known as feature creep, a strategic approach combining careful thought
and disciplined management is necessary. Here are some tactics to consider:

1. **Establish and adhere to high-level objectives**: Develop clear, overarching goals for your
   product and ensure they are consistently adhered to. This helps prevent the objectives from
   fracturing into inconsequential and trivial pursuits.
2. **Recognize the cost of new features**: Each new feature carries a cost in terms of its
   implementation, maintenance, and the added complexity it brings to the system. Always weigh the
   potential benefit of a new feature against these costs.
3. **Develop an extensible system**: Implement a plug-in or extension system where additional
   features can be incorporated as optional modules. This way, they are only added by those who
   truly need them, preserving system simplicity for other users.
4. **Perform regular maintenance and feature pruning**: Regularly review and assess the usefulness
   of the system's features. Remove or modify features that are no longer needed or rarely used to
   maintain system efficiency and simplicity.

These practices can help maintain a balance between adding useful features and avoiding excessive
complexity, thereby enhancing the product's usability and value.

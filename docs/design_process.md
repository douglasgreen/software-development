# Design Process for Web Applications

1. **Database Design**: Begin by designing the database structure, ensuring that
   it can efficiently store and manage the required data.
2. **Data Representation Layer**: Create a layer that represents the database
   objects. This can be in the form of XML, JSON, or PHP data objects. This
   layer facilitates the import and export of data and allows for scripting of
   data processing tasks.
3. **PHP Database Functions Layer**: Design a PHP layer responsible for all
   essential database operations, such as querying, updating, and deleting
   records.
4. **Command Line Utilities**: Implement a set of command line tools that can
   perform basic functions using the PHP database API. These utilities can be
   handy for administrative tasks or batch operations.
5. **Testing**: Ensure that every component of the system is thoroughly tested
   for functionality, security, and performance.
6. **Front End Design**: Design the user interface and its associated workflows
   and widgets, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience.
7. **REST API Layer**: Create a REST API layer that provides essential functions
   for the front end, allowing it to interact with the backend services and
   data.

## Layers involved

-   **Database Layer**: The foundational layer where all data is stored.
-   **Data Representation Layer**: Transforms database objects into a
    standardized format like XML or JSON.
-   **Data Storage API Layer**: Interfaces with the database to perform CRUD
    (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
-   **CLI Utilities Layer**: Provides tools for direct interaction with the
    database and other backend services.
-   **REST API Layer**: Serves as a bridge between the front end and the
    backend, facilitating data exchange.
-   **Front-End Layer**: The user interface where users interact with the
    application.

This structured approach ensures that each component of a web application is
modular, maintainable, and scalable.

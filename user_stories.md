# User stories

## Compared with use cases

User stories are used to explain the high-level details of why a user wants to do something then use cases provide the detailed implementation steps of how a user does something.

Both use cases and user stories are tools utilized in the software development process to understand and describe the user's requirements. However, they have different purposes, formats, and levels of detail. Let's break down their differences:

1. **Definition**:
   - **User Story**: It's a concise statement describing a piece of functionality from an end-user perspective. The primary goal is to capture the essence of the user's need without diving deep into the specifics. User stories are commonly written using the format: "As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit or value]."
   - **Use Case**: It's a more detailed description that outlines how a system will behave under specific conditions in response to a user trying to achieve a goal. It describes interactions between the user (or 'actor') and a system to achieve a specific outcome. Use cases provide a sequence of events and usually include alternate and exception paths.
2. **Level of Detail**:
   - **User Story**: High-level, brief, and focuses on the "what" and "why" without delving into the "how." It's more about capturing the intent of the user's need.
   - **Use Case**: More detailed, describing the step-by-step process of how the system responds to the user's actions. It goes into the specifics of "how" a feature or function will work.
3. **Purpose**:
   - **User Story**: To capture product requirements from the user's perspective, prioritize them, and facilitate conversations between developers and stakeholders.
   - **Use Case**: To provide a clear and detailed specification of system behavior and to help design and test the system.
4. **Format**:
   - **User Story**: Typically follows a simple format and is often written on index cards or in software tools specifically designed for agile methodologies.
   - **Use Case**: Structured format, usually consisting of multiple sections such as preconditions, main flow, alternate flows, postconditions, etc.
5. **Lifecycle**:
   - **User Story**: Often used in agile methodologies like Scrum. Once it's implemented and accepted, the story is considered "done."
   - **Use Case**: More commonly associated with traditional software development methodologies, although it can be used in agile projects as well.
6. **Scope**:
   - **User Story**: Typically narrower in scope, focusing on a specific need or feature.
   - **Use Case**: Can encompass a broader set of actions or interactions within a system, often covering multiple related user goals.

In practice, some projects might use a combination of both. For example, during initial brainstorming, user stories can be rapidly created to get a sense of user needs. As the project progresses and more detail is needed, use cases can be developed to provide that detailed specification for design and testing.

An example of a user story for PageMaker would be, "As a developer, I want to use an organized page building system so that I can copy front-end code between projects". The user story would be implemented in use cases that show how a page module, called a widget, is defined and copied between projects.

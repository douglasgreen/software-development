# Cargo-Cult Programming

[Cargo-cult programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming) refers to the practice of programming by imitation without understanding, leading to potential errors and inefficiencies. It takes its name from a post-World War II phenomenon involving superficial imitation of technology. There are two primary forms of cargo-cult programming that you should be aware of:

### 1. Copying and pasting code without understanding

This is the straightforward practice of copying code from one place and pasting it into another without grasping how or why it works. 

**Consequences:**
- It can produce bugs, as the copied code may not fit the new context.
- It can lead to maintenance challenges since the programmer doesn't truly understand what the code does.

### 2. Misusing tools and techniques without understanding

This is a more insidious form of the practice, where tools or techniques like REST APIs or design patterns are applied without understanding their actual costs and benefits.

**Consequences:**
- Tools might be used excessively and inappropriately, without proper guidelines.
- The misuse can lead to a poor fit for the problem, creating unnecessary complexity and poor performance.
- Often, lessons are not learned from these failures, leading to systematic design problems.

### The origin of the term

The term "cargo cult" comes from a South Pacific aboriginal religion that tried to summon planes by building mock landing strips. This ritual was based on a blind imitation of technology, without any real understanding.

### Magic thinking

The concept of cargo cult programming is akin to a form of [magical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_thinking), where objects and rituals are perceived to have inherent power. This belief can extend to the world of programming, where the complexity of powerful tools and techniques can easily lead to a misconception that simply using them imparts value or success. However, the true virtue in using these tools and techniques doesn't lie in the mere act of applying them; it comes from the critical thinking employed to understand how and why they function within a specific context. Rather than treating these elements as magical solutions, a discerning programmer recognizes that their proper utilization requires thoughtful analysis and consideration, ensuring that they are the right fit for the task at hand.

### How to avoid cargo cult programming

Rather than falling into the trap of cargo-cult programming, you should:

1. **Understand the Problem**: Clearly define the problem and the context in which you are trying to solve it.
2. **Assess the Tools**: Think critically about whether a tool or technique fits the problem and situation. Don't just use something because it worked elsewhere.
3. **Consider Design Alternatives**: Before deciding on a specific tool or technique, evaluate different options, weighing their pros and cons.

### Conclusion

Cargo-cult programming serves as a warning against the dangers of imitation without understanding. By adhering to a thoughtful process that includes understanding the problem, evaluating the appropriateness of tools and techniques, and considering alternatives, you can avoid these pitfalls and create robust and efficient code.

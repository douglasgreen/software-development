## Levels and modularity

Organizing requires you to break things down into a small number of levels. Each level should consist of a medium number of modules, arranged in a hierarchy. If you just have one module then you don't have to break it apart, just like you don't need a subdirectory if you just have one file.

## Rationality versus rationalization

Rationality means objective thinking produces valid facts and use a sound reasoning to explicitly reach conclusions. Rationalization is a week form of rationality that often is a substitute. With rationalization, you start out with a predetermined conclusion and present fake reasons for it without freely considering alternatives.

## Teamwork

The unit of productivity and software development is the team, not the individual. The most productive team is not necessarily composed of the smartest individuals as Google studies have shown. Rather it consists of people who work together constructively and communicate equally.

Adam Smith showed in Wealth of Nations that a team producing pins by assigning people specialized roles is much more productive than single individuals trying to produce their own pins. This is the principle of specialization and it is powerful. This principle should also be applied at software development by assigning specified roles to team members. For example, one person can't design the database, one person can design the API, one person can't implement the API, one person can consider network issues, one person can do debugging, etc.
